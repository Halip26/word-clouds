Many, many years ago, when Persia came ashore
Heeding Leonidas' call, the Spartans went to war
Joined by their brothers
A few against the fateful horde
Hellenic hearts are set aflame
The hot gate calls their name
A final stand
Stop the Persians, spear in hand
Form a wall
Live to fall, and live forever
Sparta! Hellas!
Then, and again, sing of three hundred men!
Slaughter! Persians!
Glory and death, Spartans will never surrender!
Morning has broken
Today they're fighting in the shade
When arrows blocked the sun, they fell
Tonight they dine in Hell
